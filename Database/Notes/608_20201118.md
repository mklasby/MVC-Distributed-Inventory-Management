### How to handle specializations with no attributes: 
* Only some have attributes that need to be stored
* Up to us to show as disjoint total / partial 
* Can assume the default is one category, must explain why default was choose a certain way
* We should *future proof* our database, what are best practices?
* Emily does have both specializations, just to visualize. 
* Important part is when we come to relational model

## How to clients link to tool?
* Two separate schemas
* would need two separate databases
* Connect to just one. Link the clients to the inventory
* Link Tool to Client with Purchase. *Wow TA Jenny strikes again!*

## What is an orderLine vs Order?
* Order has an order ID. At end of day, order will send in all of the orderLines for that day
* Should be an n-ary relationship with order, supplier, and toolid
* because tool knows its supplier, you can derive the supplier from the tool
* Emily thinks its more clear to store all 3
* Because, if we have an n-ary relationship b/w tool, supplier, and order: 
    * If every tool is only supplied from one supplier, then you don't need supplier id to be part of primary key of orderLine
    * Think about ensuring unique tuples
